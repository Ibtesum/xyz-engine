> XYZ Engine using React, Redux and Tailwind 

### Live Demo

Here you can see [:link:demo](https://64e19d7ed46b3e2d31ea94f8--stellar-truffle-0048de.netlify.app/)

### Limitations
- I focused mainly on the functionalities specified in the Assignment file.
- As a result, the UI design is not responsive also not much fancy, but it works!
- Using monitor/ any screen above 16 inches is recommended.

### Features

- Two step form
- First form with Project Name, Project Details, Client, Contractor
- Second form with input fields for max_X, min_X, max_Y, min_Y, max_Z, min_Z
- Auto completion if .csv file is uploaded
- Calculation of all six(06) fields from the csv file
- Uploading csv file is optional
- If csv file is not uploaded then the user has to manually fill up the input fields.

- After completing the second step of the form, a result page will be shown with all the input fields in a table.
- Users can download the result page table

### Bonus Task

- After the result page user can view the csv data in a *Line Chart*
